GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO PREVENT OVERFITTING
============================================================
1. DATA STRATEGIES:
   - Collect more historical data
   - Use proper train/validation/test splits
   - Implement time series cross validation

2. MODEL STRATEGIES:
   - Increase regularization (higher alpha values)
   - Reduce model complexity (lower max_depth, fewer features)
   - Use ensemble methods
   - Early stopping for iterative algorithms

3. VALIDATION STRATEGIES:
   - Always use out-of-sample validation
   - Monitor train vs validation performance
   - Test on completely unseen data
   - Use multiple evaluation metrics

4. FEATURE ENGINEERING:
   - Avoid look-ahead bias in features
   - Check for data leakage
   - Validate feature importance
   - Consider feature selection techniques
